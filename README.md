## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)

* npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```

git clone [https://github.com/AlifSrSE/Alif_Rahman.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/AlifSrSE/Alif_Rahman.git)
cd Alif_Rahman

```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```

npm install

# or

yarn install

````

### Firebase Setup (Crucial for Local Development)

This project uses Firebase for dynamic content storage (Firestore) and anonymous authentication. When running locally, you need to provide your Firebase project's configuration.

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**

* Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

* Click "Add project" and follow the steps.

2. **Register a Web App:**

* In your Firebase project, click on the `</>` icon (Web) to register a new web app.

* Follow the setup instructions and copy your Firebase configuration object. It will look something like this:

  ```
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSy...",
    authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "...",
    appId: "1:...",
    measurementId: "G-..." // Optional
  };
  
  ```

3. **Enable Anonymous Authentication:**

* In the Firebase Console, navigate to **Build > Authentication**.

* Go to the **"Sign-in method"** tab.

* Find **"Anonymous"** and enable it. This is required for the application to function locally and for basic dynamic content features.

4. **Create `.env.local` file:**

* In the **root directory** of your `Alif_Rahman` project (where `package.json` is located), create a new file named `.env.local`.

* Add your Firebase configuration to this file, **prefixed with `VITE_`**, and replace the placeholder values with your *actual* credentials.

  ```
  VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
  VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com"
  VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_ID"
  VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com"
  VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_ACTUAL_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
  VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_ACTUAL_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
  VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-YOUR_ACTUAL_MEASUREMENT_ID" # If you enabled Analytics
  VITE_APP_ID="default-local-Alif_Rahman" # A unique ID for local data
  
  ```

* **Important**: Make sure to replace all `YOUR_ACTUAL_...` placeholders with your real values.

### Running Locally

After completing the Firebase setup, run the development server:

```

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

```

The application should now open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project can be easily deployed to GitHub Pages using `gh-pages`.

1. **Configure `package.json` for `gh-pages`:**
   Ensure your `package.json` includes these lines (replace `your-username` and `Alif_Rahman` accordingly):

```

{
"name": "Alif_Rahman",
"private": true,
"version": "0.0.0",
"type": "module",
"homepage": "[https://your-username.github.io/Alif_Rahman](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://your-username.github.io/Alif_Rahman)",
"scripts": {
"dev": "vite",
"build": "vite build",
"lint": "eslint . --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
"preview": "vite preview",
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
},
"dependencies": {
// ... your dependencies
},
"devDependencies": {
"gh-pages": "^X.X.X", // Ensure gh-pages is installed
// ... other dev dependencies
}
}

```

2. **Hardcode Firebase Config in `App.jsx` for Deployment:**
Since `.env.local` files are not processed during static deployment, you **must** hardcode your Firebase configuration directly into `src/App.jsx`. Locate the `defaultFirebaseConfig` object at the top of the file and replace all placeholder values with your *actual* Firebase project details. These keys are safe to be public as Firebase security relies on Security Rules.

```

// src/App.jsx (excerpt)
const defaultFirebaseConfig = {
apiKey: "YOUR\_ACTUAL\_FIREBASE\_API\_KEY", // \<--- REPLACE THIS
authDomain: "YOUR\_ACTUAL\_PROJECT\_https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&source=gmail\&q=ID.firebaseapp.com", // \<--- REPLACE THIS
projectId: "YOUR\_ACTUAL\_PROJECT\_ID", // \<--- REPLACE THIS
storageBucket: "YOUR\_ACTUAL\_PROJECT\_https://www.google.com/url?sa=E\&source=gmail\&q=ID.appspot.com", // \<--- REPLACE THIS
messagingSenderId: "YOUR\_ACTUAL\_MESSAGING\_SENDER\_ID", // \<--- REPLACE THIS
appId: "YOUR\_ACTUAL\_FIREBASE\_APP\_ID", // \<--- REPLACE THIS
measurementId: "G-YOUR\_ACTUAL\_MEASUREMENT\_ID" // \<--- REPLACE THIS (if used)
};

```

Make sure `appId` is also a unique string suitable for deployment, e.g., `'Alif_Rahman-github-pages'`.

3. **Deploy the project:**

```

npm run deploy

# or

yarn deploy

```

This command will build your project and push the `dist` folder content to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository. Your site will typically be available at `https://your-username.github.io/Alif_Rahman`.

## üîí Firebase Security Rules (VERY IMPORTANT!)

For your data in Firestore to be secure, you **must** configure your Firebase Security Rules. The client-side API key is public, and security is enforced by these rules.

Here's an example of basic security rules that allow authenticated users (including anonymous ones) to read and write to your public portfolio collection. You can refine these further for more granular control.

```

rules\_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
match /databases/{database}/documents {
// Allows anyone who is authenticated (including anonymous users) to read and write
// to the 'portfolio' collection under your app's public data path.
// Replace `your-app-id-here` with the actual appId used in your React code
// (e.g., 'Alif_Rahman-github-pages' for deployed, or 'default-local-Alif_Rahman' for local).
match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/portfolio/{documentId} {
allow read: if request.auth \!= null;
// For adding/deleting, you might want to check if the user ID matches
// the userId stored in the document, if you want only the creator to modify.
// Example for stricter write: allow write: if request.auth \!= null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
allow write: if request.auth \!= null; // For simplicity, allows any authenticated user to write/delete
}

```

**Deploy these rules** from your Firebase Console under **Build > Firestore Database > Rules** tab.
